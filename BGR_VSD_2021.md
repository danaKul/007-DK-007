## BangdGap Reference VSD

A BGR circuit is a voltage and temperature independent voltage reference circuit that is used in integrated circuits widely for generating refernce voltages for circuits like ADC, DAC, LDO etc.
<p> In such systens typically temperature coeffience needed is 10-50ppm/deg C  0r ~10uV-50uV/deg C for vref=1V and power supply rejection, about 40-60 dB or 1-10mV/V
different basic strustures can be used to create Voltage reference like Resistor divider or  Forward bias p-n junction but they all show huge variation with temperature and supplu voltage.
###      Operating Principle
Voltage across BJT has negative temp coefficient while theraml voltage(Vt) has positive temp coefficient. If these two are added in a certain proportion, positive and negative temp coefficient cancel each other and temp independent Vreg is obtained which is ~1.2V (bandgap energy of silicon at 0 K)  <br>

 ### 1. CTAT
  Diode connected PNP, Emitter voltage here shows CTAT behaviour with temperature
CTAT slope increases with increasing number of devices or increasing current. <br>

###   2. PTAT

BJT curr equation. <br>
I= Is e(V/Vt) <br>

Gives us, <br>
V= Vt in(I/Is)   <br>

For branch A, V = Vt ln(I/Is)  and for branch B, V1= Vt ln(1/NIs) <br>
V-V1 = Vtln(N)   <br>
As discussed before Vt is PTAT  <br> 
dVt /dt = 85uV/deg C   <br>

Here, V1= voltage across the BJT is CTAT   <br>
V= Voltage cross R and Q2 is also CTAT but with lesser slope
hence we get V-V1 = voltage cross R1= PTAT

I.R1 = V=V1  = Vt Ln(N)
hence R= Vt ln(N)/I
